ScratchAddons Extention
==========
The ScratchAddons extension is going to be a bunch of Userscipts, Userstyles, and Javascipt smashed together to add funcionality and make Scratch WAY coooler. Basically, code that makes Scratch better. This will be similar to the "[Mega Scratch Userscript](https://megascratchuserscript.github.io/)", a (laggy) Userscript for Scratch 2.0. 
Also, so you're aware, Userscipts, Userstyles, & Extentions are not allowed to be mentioned on the scratch website, according to [this](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/284272/) forum post. (https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/284272/)
